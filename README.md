This is a basic program when you could find two voraz algoritms 

## 1. Voraz Coins

In this problem we have a set of coins and we have to select the least amount of coins to return a certain value. Optimization is precisely obtaining a selection with the fewest number of coins. We would apply an algorithm following the same logic that we would do manually: select one or more larger coins iteratively until we complete all the change. See that we start with the larger ones, because if we start with the smaller ones we will not optimize the objective of returning the fewest possible number of coins.

This program content two forms of this algoritm  the maximun posble coins  an  the minimum posible coins

## 2.Voraz Backpack 


Backpack problem is a very common backtracking problem.

Basically, it consists of the following: we have a backpack with a maximum size that we indicate, we also have several elements that have a weight and a value or benefit.
